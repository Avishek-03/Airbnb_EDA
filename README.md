3.Which hosts are the busiest and why?

4.What is the average price for each neighborhood group?

5.What can we learn from predictions? (ex: locations, prices, reviews, etc)

6.Is there any noticeable difference of traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for it?

# Solution to Business Objective

As per the current scenario, people usually prefer to go for an entire home because they prefer to put their privacy . So we should try investing more in renting big properties.

Also, we can say that for most of the neighborhood group, private and shared room types have somewhat similar average prices so it may be the case that people would prefer to stay in the private room category than the shared one so we should either try reducing the price of the shared room or increase the price of private room types.

We also got to know that some neighborhood groups were dense with properties whereas some had few properties i.e. were scattered which in turn led to a limit of choices for people to make before booking in a particular area, so we should also focus on including more properties there.

Through this type of analysis, we can help ourselves to make the decision wisely which is helpful to us in terms of quality and user-friendly experience.

# Conclusion

Throughout our analysis, we have gained a deeper understanding of various aspects of Airbnb, including pricing dynamics, geographical distribution, property types, and number of reviews.One of the key takeaways from our analysis is the importance of location in determining Airbnb rental prices. We found that certain neighborhoods and cities command higher prices, reflecting the influence of demand, local amenities, and tourist attractions. Hosts can use this information to optimize their pricing strategies, while travelers can make more informed choices based on their budget and preferences.In conclusion, our Airbnb EDA project has illuminated the complex landscape of Airbnb rentals, providing valuable insights for both hosts and travelers. By harnessing the power of Python and data analysis, we have unlocked the potential to make more informed decisions, ultimately enhancing the Airbnb experience for all parties involved. This project serves as a testament to the importance of data-driven decision-making in the modern world of hospitality and travel.
